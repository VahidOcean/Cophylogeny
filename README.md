# Cophylogeny
PaCo
PACo (Procrustes Application to Cophylogenetic Analysis) was originally introduced by Balbuena et al. (2013) in their study published in PLoS ONE, titled "PACo: a novel Procrustes application to cophylogenetic analysis." This groundbreaking method provides a robust framework for analyzing the degree of congruence between host and parasite phylogenies, offering insights into coevolutionary relationships.

In 2017, Hutchinson et al. extended PACo's accessibility by implementing it in the R programming environment, as described in their paper published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution, titled "paco: implementing Procrustean approach to cophylogeny in R." This R package streamlines the application of PACo, making it a user-friendly tool for researchers performing cophylogenetic analyses within the R ecosystem.
